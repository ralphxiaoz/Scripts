# Excel Metadata Extraction Configuration File
# =============================================
# This file allows you to configure all settings for the extraction tool
# without needing to provide input interactively each time you run it.
#
# To use this configuration:
#   1. Fill in the settings below with your desired values
#   2. Set 'enabled: true' at the top
#   3. Run the script - it will use these settings automatically
#
# If 'enabled: false' or this file is missing, the script will prompt you
# interactively for all settings as usual.

# Enable/disable configuration file usage
enabled: true

# Target folder settings
target_folder:
  # Absolute path to the folder you want to scan
  # Examples (Windows): "C:/Users/YourName/Documents/ExcelFiles"
  # Examples (Mac/Linux): "/Users/YourName/Documents/ExcelFiles"
  path: "C:/Users/LeifengZhou/OneDrive - Great Gray, LLC/Projects & Initiatives/202508 - RPAG PAL Feed/PAL File Examples - 202509/Original"
  
  # Folder scanning mode:
  #   "all"       - Scan all subfolders recursively
  #   "root_only" - Scan only the target folder recursively
  #   [1, 2, 3]   - Scan specific subfolders by index (see subfolder list in output)
  scan_mode: "root_only"
  
  # List of specific subfolder names to scan (alternative to scan_mode indexes)
  # If provided and not empty, this overrides scan_mode
  # Example: ["Subfolder1", "Subfolder2"]
  specific_subfolders: []

# File filtering settings
file_filtering:
  # Enable file filtering by patterns
  enabled: false
  
  # File name patterns to match (glob-style patterns)
  # Examples:
  #   - "*Sales*.xlsx"     # Files containing 'Sales' in the name
  #   - "AB*.xlsx"         # Files starting with 'AB'
  #   - "*.csv"            # All CSV files
  #   - "*Report*.txt"     # TXT files containing 'Report'
  patterns: []
  
  # If true, only select one file per pattern (the first match)
  # If false, select all files matching any pattern
  one_per_pattern: false
  
  # Alternatively, load patterns from a file
  # Set this to the path of a text file containing patterns (one per line)
  # This overrides the 'patterns' list above if provided
  pattern_file: ""

# File selection mode
file_selection:
  # How to select files to process:
  #   "all"    - Process all files found
  #   "single" - Process only one specific file (specify by name or index)
  #   "list"   - Process specific files by their indices
  mode: "all"
  
  # If mode is "single", specify the file name (e.g., "Sales_Report.xlsx")
  # or index number (1-based, e.g., 1 for first file)
  single_file: ""
  
  # If mode is "list", specify file indices to process (1-based)
  # Example: [1, 3, 5]
  file_indices: []

# Extraction settings
extraction:
  # Extraction mode:
  #   "simple" - Extract only file/sheet/column names
  #   "full"   - Extract detailed metadata (headers, types, formulas, etc.)
  mode: "simple"
  
  # Number of rows to scan when detecting headers
  scan_rows: 20
  
  # Supported file extensions (you generally don't need to change this)
  supported_extensions:
    - ".xlsx"
    - ".xls"
    - ".xlsm"
    - ".csv"
    - ".txt"
    - ".ttx"
    - ".xml"

# Output settings
output:
  # Generate JSON output
  json:
    enabled: true
    # Output filename pattern (timestamp and mode suffix will be added automatically)
    # Leave empty to use default: "excel_metadata_{timestamp}_{mode}.json"
    filename_prefix: "excel_metadata"
  
  # Generate Excel output
  excel:
    enabled: true
    # If true, an Excel file will be created from the JSON output

# Advanced settings
advanced:
  # Stop processing on first error
  stop_on_error: true
  
  # Show verbose output during processing
  verbose: true
  
  # Base folder for calculating relative paths
  # Options: "auto" (automatic detection), or specify an absolute path
  base_folder: "auto"
